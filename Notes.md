# Roadmap.

## Version 0.0.1 

I added in 3 buttons with stoarage in JSON file that stores itself in the Cashe on youre computer. So every time you start up the game you get youre stats back.

## Version 0.0.2

I added Coal per secound in to the Game. The Coal per secound is based on the Level of Level of the coal so its 1 * Level of the Coal = Coal per secound. 

## Version 0.0.3

Changed the core of the game from that you are not collecting resorces anymore now you are collecting cash to buy drills. and there is a button you can click on to make cash instead. The button yet to have updates to it only gives +1. i Added the Achivemnt 5,10,25,50 and 100 drills for all of the resources even tho its the same sprite. I changed the cost to gain ratio to the gain is Linear and the Cost is expenecial so it Becomes more and moreworth it to save up and buy the other types of resources. I could then change the price to unlock and but the next thier resources.
Smaller things added or changed
